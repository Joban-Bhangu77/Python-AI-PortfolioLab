# 🧠 Day 15 – Python Functions and Calculator Project

***

## 🌟 Project Title: Modular Arithmetic with Python Functions (Simple Calculator)

**Author:** Jobanjit Singh

### **🗓️ Day 15 of Python & AI 90-Days Learning Journey**

---

## 🎯 Overview

In **Day 15** of the learning journey, the primary focus was on establishing a solid foundation in **Python Functions**—the fundamental mechanism for creating organized, reusable, and efficient code.

The theoretical concepts were immediately put into practice by developing a **Simple Python Calculator**. This project leverages multiple distinct functions to perform basic arithmetic operations, clearly demonstrating the benefits of **modular programming**.

| **Key Feature** | **Functionality** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Addition** | Implemented using a dedicated `add()` function. |
| **Subtraction** | Implemented using a dedicated `subtract()` function. |
| **Multiplication** | Implemented using a dedicated `multiply()` function. |
| **Division** | Implemented using a dedicated `divide()` function with **error handling** for division by zero. |

## ⚙️ Code and Usage

### **Project File**

The complete calculator logic is contained in the following file: day15_functions_calculator.py

### **Sample Execution**

The calculator takes two numbers and an operator as input, then calls the appropriate function to deliver the result.

**Console Example:**

🧮 Welcome to the Python Calculator! Select operation: +, -, *, / Enter operation: + Enter first number: 12 Enter second number: 8 Result: 20.0

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

1.  **Readability and Debugging:** Breaking the calculator into separate `add`, `subtract`, etc., functions makes the main program flow clean and easy to debug.
2.  **Reusability:** Each arithmetic function can now be reused instantly in any other part of the program or future projects without needing to rewrite the logic.
3.  **Error Handling:** The `divide` function was a key practice point for incorporating basic error handling (checking for division by zero) directly within the function logic.

## 🏁 Conclusion

**Day 15** marks a crucial pivot in the learning journey: the transition from sequential scripts to **modular, professional code**.

By successfully building the Simple Calculator using dedicated functions, I have solidified my confidence in defining logical boundaries within code and embracing the principles of **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**. This foundation is essential, as functions form the backbone for creating scalable applications, sophisticated automation scripts, and complex data processing pipelines in future AI-related projects.

From here onward, I will integrate **loops, conditionals, and functions** together to create increasingly advanced mini-projects.
