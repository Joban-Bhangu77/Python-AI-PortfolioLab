# 🌟 Day 26 – Python Advanced For Loops  
Part of the **Python & AI – 90 Days Journey**

---

## 📘 Overview  
Day 26 focuses on mastering **advanced for loop techniques**, which are essential in real-world Python programming, data processing, machine learning pipelines, and automation scripts.

This lesson covers:

- Looping with `range()`
- Dictionary iteration using `.items()`
- Using `enumerate()` for indexed iteration
- Nested loops
- `break`, `continue`, and `pass` flow control
- A mini project: **Student Marks Analyzer**

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

### 🔹 1. `range()` in loops  
Used for generating sequences of numbers efficiently.

### 🔹 2. Iterating through dictionaries  
Perfect for reading structured data like JSON, API responses, and configs.

### 🔹 3. Using `enumerate()`  
Helps access both index and value during iteration.

### 🔹 4. Nested loops  
Useful for matrix operations, coordinates, and combinations.

### 🔹 5. Loop control statements  
- `break` → stop the loop  
- `continue` → skip current iteration  
- `pass` → placeholder for future logic  

### 🔹 6. Mini Project  
A **Student Marks Analyzer** that calculates:
- Total  
- Average  
- Performance rating

## 🧩 Mini Project Output Example (Student Marks Analyzer)

- **Input:** `[85, 92, 76, 88, 95]`  
- **Total:** 436  
- **Average:** 87.2  
- **Performance:** Excellent 🔥
