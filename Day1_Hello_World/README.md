# 🐍 Day 1 – Hello World in Python

### 🚀 Kickstarting My 90-Day Python Learning Journey

Today marks **Day 1** of my journey to master **Python, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning** — one line of code at a time.  

I began with the foundation of every programming adventure — the **“Hello, World!”** program. This first step may seem small, but it represents the start of a disciplined and structured learning routine aimed at building strong technical fundamentals.

### 🧠 What I Learned Today

- ✅ Installed and verified **Python 3** on my local machine  
- ✅ Explored basic syntax, indentation, and the role of the Python interpreter  
- ✅ Used the `print()` function to display output on the screen  
- ✅ Learned how to write, save, and execute a Python script  
- ✅ Understood how **VS Code** and **GitHub** streamline project organization and version control

### 💻 My First Python Program

```python
# hello_world.py
print("Hello, World!")

Output: Hello, World!

🧩 Key Takeaways

Python’s syntax is simple, readable, and beginner-friendly

Indentation defines code blocks — no curly braces needed

Learning by doing is more effective than passive reading

Every big goal starts with small, consistent progress

📚 References

Here are some helpful resources I used on Day 1 to understand the basics of Python:

Official Python Documentation
 – The best place to start learning Python from its creators.

Python.org Downloads
 – Official source to install Python on any operating system.

VS Code for Python Developers
 – A quick guide to using VS Code for Python projects.

 🧭 Conclusion

Day 1 reaffirmed that progress begins with action.
I learned how to set up my development environment, understand Python’s core syntax, and commit my first project to GitHub.

Tomorrow’s focus: exploring Python’s print functions in depth, learning how to format and structure output effectively while continuing to strengthen my version control habits.

Consistency beats motivation — and this journey is only getting started. 🚀
