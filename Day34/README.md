# 🌟 Day 34 — Python File Handling  
Part of the **Python & AI – 90 Days Journey**

## 📘 Overview  
Today I learned how Python interacts with external files — a core skill for automation, AI/ML, DevOps, and data engineering.  
This includes reading, writing, appending, and safely handling errors.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered  

### ✍️ Writing to Files  
- Creating new files  
- Overwriting existing files  
- Using `"w"` mode  

### ➕ Appending to Files  
- Adding content without deleting old content  
- Using `"a"` mode  

### 📖 Reading Files  
- `read()`  
- `readline()`  
- Looping through lines  
- Using `"r"` mode  

### ⚠️ Error Handling  
- Preventing crashes using `try/except`  
- Catching `FileNotFoundError`

## 📝 Key Takeaways  
- Always use `with open()` — it automatically closes files.  
- File handling is foundational for log analysis, data pipelines, and automation scripts.  
- Error handling ensures your script never crashes unexpectedly.  
- This will be very important for upcoming AI + data projects like **SkyGuardian-AI**.
