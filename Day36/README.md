# 🌟 Day 36 – Python Conditionals, Nested If, and Logical Operators  
Part of the **Python & AI – 90 Days Journey**

## 📘 Overview  
Today I worked on mastering **Python conditionals** — one of the most important foundations for programming, automation, AI decision flows, and cloud scripting.  
This session covered `if`, `elif`, `else`, logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`), nesting, and real-world condition building.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned  
- ✔️ Conditional Execution  
- ✔️ Multi-path Decisions using `elif`  
- ✔️ Combining conditions with logical operators  
- ✔️ Nested decision structures  
- ✔️ Real IAM-style Access Control logic  

---

## 🛡️ Mini Project: Access Control System  
A small authentication system that checks:
- Username  
- Password  
- Grants or denies access based on nested conditions  

This concept directly connects to **IAM, DevOps automation, and AI rule engines**.

## 🚀 Progress  
Each day is building my foundation stronger for automation, AI workflows, and real-world engineering logic.
