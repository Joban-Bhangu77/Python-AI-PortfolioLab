# 🧠 Day 11 – Data Structures: Lists & Tuples in Python

### 📅 Date: November 4, 2025  
### 🚀 Topic: Deep Dive into Lists & Tuples  

---

## 🧩 Project Overview
In Day 11, I focused on exploring **Python Data Structures** — specifically, **Lists and Tuples**, which are core building blocks for data organization.  

The goal was to:
- Understand how to create, manipulate, and access data in **lists**.  
- Learn how **tuples** differ from lists in terms of immutability and performance.  
- Implement these concepts in a **mini-project** — a *Grocery Price Calculator* — to practice real-world use cases of tuples and list comprehensions.

## 📚 Concepts Covered
- Creating and Accessing Lists  
- Adding, Removing, and Modifying List Elements  
- List Slicing and Comprehension  
- Nested Lists and Copying  
- Understanding Tuples and Immutability  
- Tuple Unpacking  
- Real-life Mini Project: Grocery Price Calculator

## 💻 How to Run
1. Open your terminal or IDE.  
2. Navigate to the Day 11 directory:  
   ```bash
   cd Python-AI-PortfolioLab/Day11_Data_Structues_List_&_Tuples

## Run the Python program:
python Day11_Data_Structues_List_&_Tuples.py


## Example Output
Welcome to Day 11 of Python & AI Journey - Lists & Tuples

Original List: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
After Adding: ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'cherry', 'mango']
After Removing: ['apple', 'orange', 'cherry']
Popped Item: mango
Sliced Fruits: ['apple', 'orange']

Squares using list comprehension: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
Matrix Example: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
Tuple Example: (10.5, 20.3)

## 🧠 Learning Reflection

Today’s session focused on mastering Python’s foundational data structures — lists and tuples.
I learned how lists are mutable and perfect for dynamic datasets, while tuples are immutable and efficient for fixed collections.

The Grocery Price Calculator mini-project reinforced how both can be combined to handle structured data cleanly and effectively.
This knowledge sets the stage for future topics like sets, dictionaries, and data manipulation in AI workflows.

## 🏁 Conclusion

By completing Day 11, I gained a clear understanding of how Python organizes and manages data using lists and tuples.
These data structures form the foundation of all advanced Python programming, from data analysis and automation to AI and machine learning workflows.

Moving forward, this knowledge will make it easier to grasp Sets, Dictionaries, and advanced data handling in upcoming days, strengthening my core Python base for AI development.
