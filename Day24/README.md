## 🧠 What I Learned Today

### 🔹 1. Basic Slicing  
```python
numbers[:5]      # First 5 elements  
numbers[-5:]     # Last 5 elements  
numbers[3:8]     # Slice between indices
```

### 🔹 2. Step Slicing  
```python
numbers[::2]     # Every 2nd item  
numbers[::3]     # Every 3rd item
```

### 🔹 3. Reverse Slicing  
```python
numbers[::-1]    # Reverse list  
numbers[::-2]    # Reverse every 2nd item
```

### 🔹 4. Slice Assignment  
```python
modified[2:5] = [300, 400, 500]
```

### 🔹 5. Real ML-Style Use Case  
```python
data[:3]     # first 3 labels  
data[-2:]    # last 2 labels  
data[1:-1]   # remove first and last
```

## 🏁 Conclusion  
List slicing is one of the most powerful techniques in Python.  
It allows you to manipulate sequences efficiently, which is essential for:
- Data science workflows  
- AI/ML model preprocessing  
- DevOps automation scripts  
- Any logic involving sequences or datasets  

Mastering slicing brings you one step closer to writing production-grade Python code.
